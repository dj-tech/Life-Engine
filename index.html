<p>Life Engine is an engine that allows you to create humans and manage them.
You can manage his/her friends and family and also make decisions with the human.
In the future, nature and an economical system will be added to the engine aswell.</p>

<p>Something that is also gonna be added is a fully functional brain. 
You are gonna be able to teach the brain things and the brain is gonna recognize stuff.</p>

<p>The human can have different religions and the brain of the human have cells.
If there are no cells in the brain, the person simply dies. If the person 
doesn't have a lot of brain cells, the person might remain retarded.
The point of the brain that it is gonna be realistic.</p>
